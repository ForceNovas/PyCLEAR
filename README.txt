
 This program was created by ForceNova. The main function is editing text into caps, queen-like text, and no-caps text.

 List of commands:

help // List of available programs
print // Simple text editor. Allows you to modify text into Python-style formats (title, lower, and others)
reprint // Starts new write session
save // Save file
read // Read file
edit // Edit file
!reset // Resets file directory
clear // Clears the screen from clutter.
changefolder // Changes saves folder_path
quit; !q // Close session.
check // check, if program have any save files

 This is my first program, so I won't mind criticism and notes on ways to optimize it. Written 85% by a human.
